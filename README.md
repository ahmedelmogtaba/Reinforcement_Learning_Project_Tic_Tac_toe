In this project, we used deep reinforcement learning to train an agent to play tic tac toe game.We first built an environment for the tic-tac-toe game. Then we implemented an MCTS agent. Finally we utilized the MCTS agent to train a DQN to play the tic tac toe game.

our work :

1. Implementation of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to play tic tac toe game.
2. Tic tac toe game environment.
3. Implementation of deep-Q learning algorithm to train RL agent to play tic tac toe game.

# MONTE CARLO TREE SEARCH

Monte-Carlo Tree search is made up of four distinct operations:
1. Tree Traversal/Selection.
2. Node Expansion.
3. Rollout (random simulation).
4. Backpropagation
